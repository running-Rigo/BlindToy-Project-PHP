# BlindToy-Project-PHP

This backend is part of a toy for blind dogs. POST requests are sent to the php files via the blindToy-app.
I developed this php backend, the app and the microcontroller-toy during my programming-training at Codersbay Linz.

# Features:
* register new users
* login or validate a user via the jwt-token
* add pets to a user
* delete pets of a user
* modify a specific pet

# Work in progress:
* JWT-token should be sent in header
* secret should be stored in a secret-store
* tokens should expire after a while
